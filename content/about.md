I hold an Associate of Science degree in Network Administration and Support from Parkland College, where I gained valuable skills and knowledge in IT systems and services. Currently, I work as an IT Technical Associate Help Desk Specialist at the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine, where I oversee IT support for over 300 staff and 1,000 students across multiple departments and facilities. My core competencies include help desk support, device management, network administration, and technical troubleshooting.

In my current role, I contribute to the seamless operation of critical IT infrastructure and equipment, managing a substantial inventory of over 10,000 electronic and medical devices. I use tools such as Active Directory, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, and Web Help Desk to monitor, update, and secure the devices. I also provide timely and effective IT support for various stakeholders, resolving issues and ensuring customer satisfaction. I enjoy working with a diverse and collaborative team of IT professionals, who share my passion for delivering high-quality IT solutions and services. I value continuous learning and improvement, and I seek to leverage my skills and experience to support the mission and vision of the College of Veterinary Medicine.
